---
Days: Saturdays & Sundays

Time: 2:00pm - 3:00pm

We also offer special classes for 7-9yr olds. Over the 4 days everyone will choose and make at least one project which will suit the age and ability of each student. 

This will be using hand sewing, machine sewing or often a combination of both. Don’t worry if you have never sewn before as we cater to all levels and we have loads of different projects to choose from! Sewing machines, overlockers and basic materials are provided ( see “what to bring ” below) and there are 2 teachers per class.
