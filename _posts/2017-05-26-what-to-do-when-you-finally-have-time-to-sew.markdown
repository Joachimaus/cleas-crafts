Dishes are done, the house is clean, shopping up to date, caught up with friends, now finally it's time to sew!

I'll hazard a guess that you don't feel like doing any sewing at all.
Scrolling through Pinterest Instagram browsing through fabric stores etc ...
Looking for inspiration can sadly make your "allocated sewing time" .... Evaporate!

And then you get back on the "merry go round of life" hoping for your next opportunity to sew.

This may be a bit shocking for you to realise that this can be on repeat and you may never have realised that this is what is actually happening every time you are ready to sew ... and you aren't upset about it because when it comes time to sew it's overwhelming just trying to find out what you should do first.

We are very talented at purchasing fabric and patterns. We buy patterns when we see the ones we want because if we don't, we miss out on the right size and the fabric we love. The sentence "Sorry there's none left!" is heartbreaking.

So we have the Patterns we love and the Fabric we adore (hopefully working together) and are ready to start.

We want success because our tender heart, time and money are on the line. We don't want to make the wrong choice â€¦we don't want to start the next step. Will this next step take us closer to Failure or Fabulous? It's darn nerve-racking!

But good time management is our best friend.
