Are you tired of paying someone else to repair or alter your clothing? Do you enjoy looking at different fabrics and baubles and wish you had the skills to create lovely treasures with them? Is your imagination full of clothing designs just waiting to be created, but the thought of using a sewing machine intimidates you out of trying?
<br>
<br>
In sewing classes, you can learn how to do all of these things and turn your creative dreams into reality. In lessons, you'll learn all the skills you need to know to design and create interesting textiles for your home, repair and alter clothing, and to create complete garments from your own patterns. You'll learn hand stitches, how to use different sewing machines, the basics of understanding fabric, how to use a commercial pattern, and more!
